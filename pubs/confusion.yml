  Designing Alternative Representations of Confusion Matrices to Support
  Non-Expert Public Understanding of Algorithm Performance
desc: >-
  We studied how non-experts use confusion matrices to understand machine
  learning models. We then developed and tested multiple alternative
  representations of model performance, finding that contextualized and
  direcitonal representations are the most useful modifications for improving
  understanding.

abstract: >-
  Ensuring effective public understanding of algorithmic decisions that are
  powered by machine learning techniques has become an urgent task with the
  increasing deployment of AI systems into our society. In this work, we
  present a concrete step toward this goal by redesigning confusion matrices
  for binary classification to support non-experts in understanding the
  performance of machine learning models. Through interviews (n=7) and a
  survey (n=102), we mapped out two major sets of challenges lay people have
  in understanding standard confusion matrices: the general terminologies and
  the matrix design. We further identified three sub-challenges regarding the
  matrix design, namely, confusion about the direction of reading the data,
  layered relations and quantities involved. We then conducted an online
  experiment with 483 participants to evaluate how effective a series of
  alternative representations target each of those challenges in the context
  of an algorithm for making recidivism predictions. We developed three levels
  of questions to evaluate users' objective understanding. We assessed the
  effectiveness of our alternatives for accuracy in answering those questions,
  completion time, and subjective understanding. Our results suggest that (1)
  only by contextualizing terminologies can we significantly improve users'
  understanding and (2) flow charts, which help point out the direction of
  reading the data, were most useful in improving objective understanding. Our
  findings set the stage for developing more intuitive and generally
  understandable representations of the performance of machine learning
  models.
