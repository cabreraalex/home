title: Interactive Classification for Deep Learning Interpretation
desc: >-
  We developed an interactive system that allows users to modify images to
  explore the weaknesses and strenghts of image classification models. Users
  can 'inpaint' or remove parts of an image and see how it impacts their
  classification.

abstract: >-
  We present an interactive system enabling users to manipulate images to
  explore the robustness and sensitivity of deep learning image classifiers.
  Using modern web technologies to run in-browser inference, users can remove
  image features using inpainting algorithms to obtain new classifications in
  real time. This system allows users to compare and contrast what image
  regions humans and machine learning models use for classification.
