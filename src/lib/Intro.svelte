	I am currently a founding engineer at <a href="https://axi.om">Axiom Bio</a>, applying ML to
	predict molecular toxicity.

	<br />

	Previously, I got my PhD in the
	<a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/"> Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) </a>
	at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by
	<a href="http://perer.org">Adam Perer</a>
	and
	<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/">Jason Hong.</a>
	I worked on human-centered AI, specifically using techniques from HCI and visualization to help people
	better understand and improve their AI systems. I was supported by an
	<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>
	and have spent time at Apple AI/ML, Microsoft Research, & Google.
