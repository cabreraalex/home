title: Discovering and Validating AI Errors With Crowdsourced Failure Reports
desc: >-
  We introduce failure reports, end-user descriptions of how an AI system
  failed, and show how they can be used to detect systematic AI errors. We
  also designed and implemented Deblinder, a visual analytics system data
  scientists can use to explore and validate patterns from failure reports. In
  a user study, we found that data scientists found consistent failures and
  that collecting data from those failure areas significantly increased model
  performance.

  AI systems can fail to learn important behaviors, leading to real-world
  issues like safety concerns and biases. Unfortunately, discovering these
  systematic failures often requires significant developer attention, from
  hypothesizing potential edge cases to collecting evidence and validating
  patterns. To scale and streamlinethis process, we introduce failure reports,
  end-user descriptions of how or why a model failed, and show how developers
  can use them to detect AI errors. We also design and implement Deblinder, a
  visual analytics system for synthesizing failure reports that developers can
  use to discover and validate systematic failures. In semi-structured
  interviews and think-aloud studies with 10 AI practitioners, we explore the
  affordances of the Deblinder system and the applicability of failure reports
  in real-world settings. Lastly, we show how collecting additional data from
  the groups identified by developers can improve model performance.
