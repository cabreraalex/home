title: An open repository of real-time COVID-19 indicators
desc: 'We created an interactive dashboard for tracking COVID-19 indicators. The
  indicators are collected from various sources such as social media surveys
  and testing labs, and can be used to predict or better understand factors in
  the spread and severity of COVID-19.'

abstract: 'The COVID-19 pandemic presented enormous data challenges in the United
  States. Policy makers, epidemiological modelers, and health researchers all
  require up-to-date data on the pandemic and relevant public behavior,
  ideally at fine spatial and temporal resolution. The COVIDcast API is our
  attempt to fill this need: Operational since April 2020, it provides open
  access to both traditional public health surveillance signals (cases,
  deaths, and hospitalizations) and many auxiliary indicators of COVID-19
  activity, such as signals extracted from deidentified medical claims data,
  massive online surveys, cell phone mobility data, and internet search
  trends. These are available at a fine geographic resolution (mostly at the
  county level) and are updated daily. The COVIDcast API also tracks all
  revisions to historical data, allowing modelers to account for the frequent
  revisions and backfill that are common for many public health data sources.
  All of the data are available in a common format through the API and
  accompanying R and Python software packages. This paper describes the data
  sources and signals, and provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary
  signals in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID
  activity, augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering
  research and decision-making.'
