abstract: >-
  This position paper offers a framework to think about how to better involve
  human influence in algorithmic decision-making of contentious public policy
  issues. Drawing from insights in communication literature, we introduce a
  ``public(s)-in-the-loop'' approach and enumerates three features that are
  central to this approach: publics as plural political entities, collective
  decision-making through deliberation, and the construction of publics. It
  explores how these features might advance our understanding of stakeholder
  participation in AI design in contentious public policy domains such as
  recidivism prediction. Finally, it sketches out part of a research agenda
  for the HCI community to support this work.
