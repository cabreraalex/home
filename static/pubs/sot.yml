title: Accurate and interpretable in silico clinical risk assessment for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from molecular structure
abstract: >-
  Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of clinical trial failure and drug withdrawal, but
  current methods fail to provide accurate and interpretable clinical risk at human-relevant exposure.
  We profiled >100,000 unique molecules in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) using a multiplexed
  cytotoxicity assay with high content imaging & two biochemical assays (LDH & Realtime Glo/MT-Glo).
  We train in silico models to predict dose-dependent responses for >10 distinct cell stress and death
  features from the images solely from 2D molecular structure (SMILES string).
  Our in silico features & thousands of clinical data points are used to train an in silico clinical risk
  assessment model that outperforms industry-leading in vitro assays in accuracy & interpretability.
